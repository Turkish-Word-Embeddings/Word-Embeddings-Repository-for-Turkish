This is the same dataset utilized in the work that we consider as baseline for comparison (Türkmenoğlu and Tantuğ 2014). The size of the dataset is 20,244 reviews, where the average number of words per review is 39. The reviews have star scores ranging from 0.5 to 5 in increments of 0.5 points. If the score of a review is equal to or lower than 2.5, it is considered as negative, whereas if the score is equal to or higher than 4, it is considered as positive. Accordingly, there are 13,224 positive reviews and 7020 negative reviews in this corpus.
